> - ### laboratory work number:  
>   **Regular expression which should support the following:**
> - ### variant description (variant 6):  
>   - Support special characters: \, ^, ., $, *, +, [ ], 【^ 】, { }.  
>   - Support functions: match, sub. 
>   - Visualization as a finite state machine (state diagram or table).
- ### synopsis:
>   -We use the NFA way to write our regular expression state machine, first  perform the lexical analysis of the expression, then use the bottom-up  method for grammatical analysis, and then establish NFA, and finally  used to match the string.

## Task division
> - Complete the basic code part together include  nfa_construction.py,nfa_morphology.py, nfa_rgx.py,test.py``.(**Yong Ding**, **Jie Ruan**)   
> - Based on the existing code, many tests are performed to correct the error code. (**Yong Ding**)  
> - Fix bug and writing reports. (**Jie Ruan**)
